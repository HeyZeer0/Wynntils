About Wynntils
========
Wynntils is a Wynncraft mod that seeks to enhance the user's gameplay with a variety of customizable options and additions.

Setup the Workspace
========
To set up the workspace, you'll need to run the Forge ``setupDecompWorkspace`` gradle command, with that all the Forge source will be generated. It's that easy!
<br> Building the mod is even simpler. Just call the ``buildDependents`` and the artifact should be generated.

You can also setup a test environment. Using IntelliJ, execute the ``genIntellijRuns`` task, which will generate a run environment for you.
 
Pull Request
========

All pull requests are welcome. We'll analyse it and if we determine it should a part of the mod, we'll implement it.

We welcome all forms of assistance. =)
