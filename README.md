About Wynntils
========
Wynntils is a Wynncraft mod that seeks to enhance the user's gameplay with a variety of customizable options and additions.
If you find any bug or have crashed because of the mod, please report it at our <a href="https://discord.gg/SZuNem8">official Discord server</a>!

Setup the Workspace
========
To set up the workspace, just import the project as a gradle project into your IDE
<br> To build the mod just call the ``buildDependents`` and the artifact should be generated in `build/libs`.

You can also setup a test environment. Run the task for generating run configurations for your IDE

* Eclipse - `genEclipseRuns`
* Intellij - `genIntellijRuns`
* VSCode - `genVSCodeRuns`

When launching a run configuration use the generated run configuration

* All IDEs - `runClient`

<h2>Authenticating</h2>
To authenticate in the development environment, you should use <a href="https://github.com/DJtheRedstoner/DevAuth">DevAuth</a>.
<br> Download and place the `forge-legacy`.jar from their <a href="https://github.com/DJtheRedstoner/DevAuth/releases">releases</a> in `run/mods`.
<br> When you first launch the game with the generated `runClient` task, there will be a prompt in the console with a link to authenticate.
No other configuration is required.

<h3>Alternative Accounts</h3>
This repository is pre-configured with one main and one alternative account.
To use the alternative account, you should duplicate, then edit the generated `runClient` configuration.
<br> In the JVM arguments for your duplicated configuration, add `-Ddevauth.account=alt`.
You will be prompted to authenticate with the new account when you run the new instance.
<br> To add more alternative accounts, you should edit `.devauth/config.toml` in your local copy of this repository and follow the existing entries as examples.
You may also refer to the DevAuth repository for more information.
